# Algorithm for file updates in Python
-Project description
You are a security professional at a healthcare company tasked with managing access to sensitive patient records. You maintain an allow list of IP addresses for employees authorized to access restricted content and a remove list for those who need to be revoked. Your goal is to create a Python algorithm that checks the allow list against the remove list and removes any matching IP addresses, ensuring only authorized employees retain access.
# Open the file that contains the allow list
import_file = "allow_list.txt"
# Read the file contents
ip_addresses = file.read()
# Convert the string into a list
ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split("\n")
# Iterate through the remove list
  remove_list = ["192.168.1.100", "10.0.0.5", "172.16.0.2"]
# Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list
 if element in ip_addresses:
            ip_addresses.remove(element)
# Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses 
updated_content = "\n".join(ip_addresses)
    with open(import_file, "w") as file:
        file.write(updated_content)
# Summary
This algorithm checks the "allow_list.txt" file for unauthorized IP addresses found in the "remove_list" and updates the file by removing these addresses. It begins by opening the file, reading its contents, and converting them into a list. Then, it iterates through the "remove_list" and removes any matching IP addresses from the list. Finally, the updated list is converted back to a string and written back to the file.

By implementing this algorithm, we can efficiently manage access control lists, ensuring that only authorized employees have access to restricted content, which is crucial for maintaining data security and privacy in a healthcare environment.
