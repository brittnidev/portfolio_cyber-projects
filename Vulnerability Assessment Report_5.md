# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## System Description
The e-commerce company's database server is a remote resource that stores valuable customer data, including personal and financial information. The server has been publicly accessible since the company's launch, allowing employees to query data remotely from various global locations. This open access creates a significant attack surface that malicious actors could exploit, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and service disruptions.

## Scope
This vulnerability assessment focuses on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on the remote database server. It excludes physical security measures related to the server's infrastructure.

## Purpose
The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to identify and analyze risks associated with the publicly accessible database server. Securing this server is critical to protect sensitive customer information, ensure compliance with data protection regulations, and maintain customer trust. A compromised server could lead to significant operational disruptions, financial loss, and damage to the companyâ€™s reputation.

 ## Risk Assessment

     | Threat Source                   | Threat Event                           | Likelihood (1-3) | Severity (1-3) | Risk Score (1-9) |
     |---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
     | Unauthorized access             | SQL Injection Attack                   | 3                | 3              | 9                |
     | Data exfiltration               | Data Breach via Misconfigured Access   | 2                | 3              | 6                |
     | Denial of Service (DoS) attacks | Service Disruption via DoS Attack      | 2                | 2              | 4                |

## Approach
The selected threat sources and events reflect the most pressing vulnerabilities associated with the open database server. Unauthorized access is particularly significant due to the potential for data breaches, which can lead to severe financial and reputational damage. Additionally, the risk of data exfiltration and DoS attacks could disrupt business operations and hinder the company's ability to serve its customers effectively.

## Remediation
To mitigate the identified risks, the following security controls should be implemented:

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit access to the database server to only those employees who require it for their roles, thereby reducing unauthorized access risks.
     
 2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA for all users accessing the database to ensure that even if credentials are compromised, additional verification is required for access.

3. **Defense in**
